# Assessment-1---Web-Development
HomeTown Website 

I started by setting the basic necessary requirements - DOCTYPE, HTML language, charset and all the meta features.
Brainstormed a few names, initially liked Experience Egypt but found many existing websites with similar names and so it came down to Experience Egypt.

To ensure that I reduce repetitive code, I found that using :root and var will allow me to access certain styling functions wihtout having to recode fully.

I researched how to incorporate some elements within the css file and found that using "hero" will allow me to add a banner with the full width of the page. Removed hero.

I set a padding of 80px for navigation in mobile devices and set the overflow-x to be hidden, so that there is no overflowing content from the sides and no scrollbar.

Used flex in the display and positioned it as column, to have the navigational buttons shown as am obelisk vertically.

Used root to store colours and use them in var() later on, making my code efficient and easy to structure.

Chose similar colours to the egyptian giza plateau, nile and nightsky. Found the colours blending very well and representing egypt well.

Later on, I decided to have 5 webpages interlinked and initiated their design in the footer section. This will allow me to have a better picture on how I want the pages to look like.

Having issues making a video the banner - was able to load the video but js script was not implementing and video is not the right size.

Fixed the banner without the use of js however it requires previous interaction with the code to autplay - since audio is included. Sacrificed autoplay for the audio element as I believe it is essential for the website.

Built an itineraryy with hovering pictures that link to specific sections in the visit page. 

Changed the font and colours of the screen multiple times to efficiently make it easy on the eyes.

Built the visit page with a postcard theme and swiping between pictures - scrollbar included for different devices.

Found the images cluttering the space and it was crowded, I made it focus on 1-2 site, this made it look neat and professional. Along with styling like border radius and shadow.

Checked assessment criteria and found that I must use bootstrap and will implement that to existing code.

Contemplating whether I should focus on one hometown or will my website be accepted by the professor - will ask the next lecture.

Finalised the contacts page and made it simple to interact with. Initially had a password but remembered it was a feedback/question section and so I removed it.

The background was white and I later realised it made the page look very empty and unrelated. Chose between a few pictures to be the backrgound and finalised on one.

Started adding more elements to the home page that introduces a user to the website, who the 'organisation' is and the purpose behind it.

Realised that the issue causing the navigational panel to not work effectively on a touch device was that I accidentally used 'div' instead of 'nav'. After implementing the change, the navigation panel was working effectively.

Utilised more font-awesome icons as I found it appealing and a factor of the modern/professional look of the website.

Jotted down some ideas in the history page to work on next time and hoping to finalise the project in the next 2 days.

Found a lot of mobile compatibility errors and had to implement @media to fix these issues. Still need to fix a few more issues.

Home page 80% complete and contacts page requires a few more changes due to send button positioning.

Implemented bootstrap code and made it as similar as possible whilst implementing new features like the list group and list item action to show different 'tabs'.

Was able to create a hidden checkboz to fix the nav panel and make it work in the 2 History and Contact pages on a mobile

Added a map on the home page.

Had a final test for all the links of recipes, locations and for the website as a whole.

Ended my project by making the video have controls to still preserve the audio element.

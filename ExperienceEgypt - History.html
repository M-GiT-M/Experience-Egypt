                <p> The <strong> Golden Age </strong> of Egyptian Cinema (1940s-1960s) was considered the peak of
                    Egyptian Cinema. Cairo was then considered <em> "The Hollywood of the East" </em> with hundreds of
                    films produced annually. </p>
                <p> Many genres were produced but they all conveyed a rich story and contained elements of emotional
                    drama that resonated with its audience. Soon enough, the Egyptian Dialect was the standard for the
                    MENA region and an example of this was Walt Disney choosing the Egyptian Dialect for his Arabic
                    Versions of his cartoon films. This was due to the Egyptians perfecting communication that entailed
                    an emotion, portraying love, humuour and other emotions excellently. </p>
                <p> It is known that to this day, for an actor to grow in the MENA region, they should work in an
                    Egyptian Production. As Egyptian Arabic has become the standard, popular and comfort choice amongst
                    the audience of the region centuries ago. </p>
